(Operating Systems I)

I have been assigned with the development of a command line application for a Unix environment. 

The main goal of this project is to mediate the interactions between patients, doctors, and front desk staff in a healthcare setting. The project primarily focuses on the knowledge of the Unix operating system.

The practical work is done in C language, for a Unix platform (Linux). When dealing with system resources manipulation, it was necessary to prioritize the use of system calls over library functions (for example, use read() and write() instead of fread() and fwrite()).

# My personal analysis of the project

As I reflect upon the completion of this project, I have to say that it was a very interesting experience for me. I enjoyed working in the C programming language within a Linux environment, it was a new experience for me and I learned a lot. Additionally, this was my first time working with threads and named pipes, and it was a great opportunity to learn more about these specific features. Overall, this project presented a significant challenge but it was fun at the same time. Despite the difficulties, I am pleased with the work done and I feel that this project has been a great learning experience for me.
